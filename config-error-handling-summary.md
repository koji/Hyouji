# Configuration Error Handling Implementation Summary

## Task 6: Create comprehensive error handling - COMPLETED ✅

This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive error handling for the GitHub Label Manager configuration system.

## Sub-tasks Completed

### 6.1 Add configuration error handling ✅

**Implemented Features:**

- **Graceful fallback for corrupted config files**: When a config file contains invalid JSON or is corrupted, the system now creates a backup of the corrupted file and gracefully falls back to prompting for new credentials.
- **File permission error handling**: Added comprehensive handling for permission denied errors (EACCES, EPERM) with user-friendly messages.
- **User-friendly error messages**: All configuration errors now display clear, actionable messages that help users understand and resolve issues.

**Key Enhancements:**

- Added `ConfigError` class with specific error types (`ConfigErrorType` enum)
- Enhanced `loadConfig()` method with robust error handling for each configuration location
- Added `backupCorruptedFile()` method to preserve corrupted configurations
- Improved `saveConfig()` method with fallback location handling
- Enhanced `clearConfig()` method with proper error reporting

### 6.2 Add validation for saved credentials ✅

**Implemented Features:**

- **Token validation against GitHub API**: Added `validateCredentials()` method that makes an actual API call to verify token validity and user ownership.
- **Prompt for new credentials when validation fails**: When saved credentials are invalid, the system prompts for new credentials while preserving valid parts of the configuration.
- **Preserve valid configuration parts**: If only the token is invalid but the username is correct, the system preserves the username and pre-fills it in the prompt.

**Key Enhancements:**

- Added `validateCredentials()` method with comprehensive API error handling
- Added `loadValidatedConfig()` method that combines loading and validation
- Enhanced `inputGitHubConfig.ts` to use validated configuration loading
- Added logic to pre-fill preserved data (like username) in prompts
- Added success messages when configuration is updated vs. newly created

## Error Types Handled

The implementation handles the following error scenarios:

1. **FILE_NOT_FOUND**: Configuration file doesn't exist
2. **PERMISSION_DENIED**: Insufficient permissions to read/write config files
3. **CORRUPTED_FILE**: Invalid JSON syntax or empty files
4. **INVALID_FORMAT**: Missing required fields or invalid token format
5. **NETWORK_ERROR**: Unable to connect to GitHub API for validation
6. **UNKNOWN_ERROR**: Unexpected errors with detailed messages

## User Experience Improvements

### Error Messages

- Clear, actionable error messages with specific file paths
- Warnings that explain what will happen next (e.g., "you'll be prompted for credentials")
- Success messages when configuration is saved or updated

### Graceful Degradation

- Corrupted files are backed up before being ignored
- Invalid credentials prompt for new ones while preserving valid data
- Permission errors provide specific guidance on resolution

### Recovery Mechanisms

- Multiple configuration locations (primary and fallback)
- Automatic fallback when primary location fails
- Preservation of valid configuration parts during credential updates

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/configManager.ts**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling classes and methods
   - Enhanced all configuration operations with proper error handling
   - Added credential validation against GitHub API

2. **src/lib/inputGitHubConfig.ts**:
   - Updated to use validated configuration loading
   - Added logic to preserve and pre-fill valid configuration data
   - Enhanced error handling for configuration save operations

## Testing and Verification

Created verification tools:

- `verify-config-error-handling.cjs`: Creates test scenarios for manual verification
- `test-config-validation.mjs`: Automated tests for validation logic (requires TypeScript compilation)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 2.5**: IF saved credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt for new credentials
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL use appropriate file permissions to protect sensitive data
✅ **Requirement 2.4**: WHEN saved credentials are used THEN the system SHALL validate them before proceeding

## Conclusion

The comprehensive error handling implementation provides a robust, user-friendly experience for configuration management. Users will now receive clear feedback about configuration issues and the system will gracefully handle various error scenarios while preserving as much valid data as possible.

**Task 6 Status: COMPLETED ✅**
