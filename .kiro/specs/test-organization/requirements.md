# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hyouji project currently has numerous test files scattered throughout the root directory, making the project structure cluttered and difficult to navigate. These test files serve different purposes including error handling validation, configuration testing, integration testing, and manual verification. The goal is to organize these test files into a logical directory structure that improves maintainability, discoverability, and follows testing best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Hyouji project, I want test files organized in a clear directory structure, so that I can easily find and run specific types of tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the project root THEN I SHALL see a clean structure without scattered test files
2. WHEN I need to run error handling tests THEN I SHALL find them in a dedicated directory
3. WHEN I need to run integration tests THEN I SHALL find them in a separate directory from unit tests
4. WHEN I need to run configuration tests THEN I SHALL find them grouped together

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to follow consistent naming conventions, so that I can understand their purpose at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I see a test file name THEN I SHALL understand what type of test it is
2. WHEN test files are related THEN they SHALL follow similar naming patterns
3. WHEN I look at test directories THEN the structure SHALL be self-documenting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test scripts to be easily executable, so that I can run them without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to run all tests of a specific type THEN I SHALL have a simple command to do so
2. WHEN test files are moved THEN their functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN I run tests THEN the output SHALL clearly indicate which test category is running

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test data files organized alongside their related tests, so that I can understand test dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files require test data THEN the data SHALL be located near the tests
2. WHEN I modify test data THEN I SHALL easily identify which tests are affected
3. WHEN test data is shared THEN it SHALL be in a common location with clear naming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want package.json scripts updated to work with the new test organization, so that existing workflows continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run existing npm test commands THEN they SHALL work with the new structure
2. WHEN new test categories are added THEN they SHALL have corresponding npm scripts
3. WHEN CI/CD runs tests THEN it SHALL work with the reorganized structure
