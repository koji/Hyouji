# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing GitHub Label Manager tool to be distributed as an npm package with improved user experience. The enhancement focuses on eliminating the need for manual build steps, implementing persistent configuration storage, and adding configuration management capabilities. Users will be able to install and use the tool directly from npm without cloning and building the repository.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and use the GitHub Label Manager directly from npm, so that I can manage GitHub labels without cloning and building the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `npm install -g github-label-manager` THEN the system SHALL install the package globally
2. WHEN a user runs the package command THEN the system SHALL start the application without requiring build steps
3. WHEN the package is built THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the primary build tool
4. WHEN the package is published THEN the system SHALL include all necessary built files and dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my GitHub personal token and account name to be saved after first use, so that I don't have to enter them repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the application for the first time THEN the system SHALL prompt for GitHub personal token and account name
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL save them to a persistent configuration file
3. WHEN a user runs the application on subsequent uses AND valid credentials exist THEN the system SHALL NOT prompt for token and account name
4. WHEN saved credentials are used THEN the system SHALL validate them before proceeding
5. IF saved credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt for new credentials

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my saved settings, so that I can verify what credentials and configuration are currently stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Display your settings" from the main menu THEN the system SHALL show the path to the configuration file
2. WHEN displaying settings THEN the system SHALL show the stored GitHub account name
3. WHEN displaying settings THEN the system SHALL NOT show the actual personal token for security reasons
4. WHEN displaying settings THEN the system SHALL indicate whether a token is saved or not
5. WHEN no configuration file exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the configuration to be stored securely and in a standard location, so that my credentials are protected and easily manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL store it in the user's home directory
2. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL use appropriate file permissions to protect sensitive data
3. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL use a standard configuration directory structure
4. WHEN configuration file is created THEN the system SHALL use JSON format for easy readability and editing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to have proper CLI binaries configured, so that I can run the tool from anywhere after global installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed globally THEN the system SHALL create a CLI command that can be run from anywhere
2. WHEN the CLI command is executed THEN the system SHALL start the main application
3. WHEN package.json is configured THEN the system SHALL include proper bin field for CLI access
4. WHEN the package is built THEN the system SHALL ensure the CLI entry point has proper executable permissions
