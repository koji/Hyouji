# Requirements Document

## Introduction

この機能は、GitHub Label Managerプロジェクトに継続的インテグレーション（CI）と継続的デプロイメント（CD）のパイプラインを追加します。GitHub Actionsを使用して、コードの変更時に自動的にテストを実行し、リリース時にパッケージをビルドしてnpmに公開する機能を提供します。これにより、開発プロセスの自動化と品質保証が向上します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests to run on every push and pull request, so that code quality is maintained and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the system SHALL automatically run all unit tests
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL run tests and report results in the PR
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merging and display clear error messages
4. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL show a green status check
5. WHEN the workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use Node.js version 22

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want packages to be automatically built and published to npm when I create a release, so that users can access new versions without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release tag is created THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the publish workflow
2. WHEN the publish workflow runs THEN the system SHALL build the package using Vite
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL publish the package to npm
4. WHEN publishing THEN the system SHALL use the version from package.json
5. WHEN publishing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fail the workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to validate package integrity, so that only properly built and tested packages are published.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the publish workflow runs THEN the system SHALL run all tests before building
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with the build process
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL verify the built package structure
4. WHEN package verification passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with npm publishing
5. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the pipeline and report the failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want secure npm authentication in the CI/CD pipeline, so that package publishing is protected and authorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the publish workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use npm authentication tokens stored as GitHub secrets
2. WHEN authenticating with npm THEN the system SHALL use secure token management practices
3. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the system SHALL NOT expose sensitive authentication information in logs
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing tokens
5. WHEN setting up the workflow THEN the system SHALL require NPM_TOKEN to be configured as a repository secret

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD workflows to be efficient and provide clear feedback, so that I can quickly understand build status and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows run THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits (under 10 minutes)
2. WHEN workflows fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and error messages
3. WHEN workflows succeed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful completion
4. WHEN workflows run THEN the system SHALL use Node.js 22 for consistency
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL cache node_modules for faster subsequent runs
