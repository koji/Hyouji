npx hyouji

# This downloads and runs the latest version temporarily
# Great for one-time use or testing before committing to installation
```

#### Verification

After global installation, verify Hyouji is properly installed:

```bash
# Check if Hyouji is available globally
hyouji --version

# Or simply run the tool
hyouji
```

### Step-by-Step First-Time Setup

When you run Hyouji for the first time, you'll go through a secure, guided setup process. Here's exactly what to expect:

#### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Personal Access Token

Before using Hyouji, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions:

1. **Navigate to GitHub Token Settings**
   - Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
   - Or navigate manually: GitHub Profile → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

2. **Generate New Token**
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name like "Hyouji Label Manager"
   - Set an appropriate expiration date (30 days, 90 days, or custom)

3. **Configure Token Permissions**
   - **Required**: Select the `repo` scope for full repository access
   - This includes: `repo:status`, `repo_deployment`, `public_repo`, and `repo:invite`
   - **Why this scope?** Hyouji needs to read repository information and manage labels

4. **Save Your Token**
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Important**: Copy the token immediately—GitHub won't show it again
   - Store it temporarily in a secure location (you'll enter it in the next step)

#### Step 2: Initial Configuration

Launch Hyouji and follow the interactive setup:

```bash
hyouji
```

**What You'll See:**

```text
Welcome to Hyouji (表示) - GitHub Label Manager!

With this comprehensive setup guide, you're ready to start managing your GitHub labels efficiently and securely. The next section will show you practical examples of how to use Hyouji's powerful features.

## Usage Examples

Let's walk through common scenarios where Hyouji shines, showing you exactly how to accomplish typical label management tasks.

### Creating Labels

**Single Label Creation**

When you need to add a specific label to your repository:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
# Select: "create a label"
# Enter label name: "urgent-bug"
# Enter color (without #): "ff0000"
# Enter description: "Critical bugs requiring immediate attention"
```

The interactive menu guides you through each step, ensuring you don't miss any important details.

**Quick Single Label**
For experienced users, the process becomes second nature—launch Hyouji, select option 1, fill in the details, and you're done in under 30 seconds.

### Managing Multiple Labels

**Bulk Label Creation**

Setting up a new project with a complete label system:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
# Select: "create multiple labels"
```

This option uses Hyouji's built-in label set, which includes:

- **Type Labels**: Bug Fix, Enhancement, Improvement, Security Fix
- **Status Labels**: Available, In Progress, Completed, Canceled
- **Priority Labels**: ASAP, High, Medium, Low, Safe
- **Effort Labels**: Effortless, Light, Normal, Heavy, Painful

**Bulk Deletion**

When you need to clean up a repository:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
# Select: "delete all labels"
# Confirm the action when prompted
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This removes ALL labels from your repository. Use with caution!

### Importing from Files

**File-Based Label Management**

For teams that want to version-control their label configurations:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
# Select: "import labels from JSON or YAML"
# Enter file path: "./project-labels.json"
```

This approach is perfect for:

- **Standardizing across repositories**: Use the same label file for multiple projects
- **Version control**: Track changes to your label system over time
- **Team collaboration**: Share label configurations through your repository
- **Backup and restore**: Keep your label configurations safe

### Navigation Tips

The Hyouji menu is designed for efficiency:

- Use arrow keys to navigate options
- Press Enter to select
- If you don't see the selector, press the spacebar
- Type 'exit' or select the exit option to quit anytime

## File Format Support

Hyouji supports both JSON and YAML formats for importing labels, giving you flexibility in how you structure and maintain your label configurations.

### JSON Format

JSON format is perfect for programmatic generation and integration with other tools:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "bug",
    "color": "d73a4a",
    "description": "Something isn't working"
  },
  {
    "name": "enhancement",
    "color": "a2eeef",
    "description": "New feature or request"
  },
  {
    "name": "documentation",
    "color": "0075ca",
    "description": "Improvements or additions to documentation"
  },
  {
    "name": "good first issue",
    "color": "7057ff",
    "description": "Good for newcomers"
  },
  {
    "name": "wontfix",
    "color": "ffffff"
  },
  {
    "name": "question",
    "description": "Further information is requested"
  }
]
```

**Key Points:**

- `name` is required for all labels
- `color` is optional (GitHub will assign a default if omitted)
- `description` is optional but recommended for clarity
- Colors should be hex codes without the `#` symbol

### YAML Format

YAML format offers better readability and is easier to edit manually:

```yaml
# Project Management Labels
- name: 'Type: Bug Fix'
  color: 'FF8A65'
  description: 'Fix features that are not working'

  color: '64B5F7'
  description: 'Add new features'

- name: 'Status: In Progress'
  color: '64B5F7'
  description: 'Currently working on it'

# Priority Labels
- name: 'Priority: High'
  color: 'FFB74D'
  description: 'We must work on it'

- name: 'Priority: Low'
  color: 'DCE775'
  description: 'We should work on it'

# Minimal labels (name only)
- name: 'needs-review'
- name: 'approved'
```

**YAML Advantages:**

- Comments supported for documentation
- More human-readable format
- Easier to edit in text editors

Every GitHub personal access token is automatically encrypted before being saved to disk using machine-specific encryption keys. This means:

- **Machine-Specific Security**: Encryption keys are derived from your system information
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Tokens are never stored in readable format
- **Automatic Migration**: Existing plain text configurations are automatically upgraded to encrypted format
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux

**How It Works:**

```text
# When you first enter your token
Your token: ghp_1234567890abcdef...
# Hyouji automatically encrypts it before saving
Saved token: [encrypted_data_here]
```

### Configuration Management

**Secure Storage Locations**
Hyouji stores your configuration in standard system locations:

- **Primary**: `~/.config/github-label-manager/config.json`
- **Fallback**: `~/.github-label-manager-config.json`

**Privacy Protection**
Your tokens are never exposed in the user interface:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
# Select: "Display your settings"

=== Current Settings ===
Configuration file path: ~/.config/github-label-manager/config.json
GitHub account: your-username
Personal token: ✓ Saved and encrypted
Token preview: ghp_****...****3456
Last updated: 2024-01-15 10:30:45
```

**Key Security Features:**

- **Obfuscated Display**: Only shows first/last characters of tokens
- **Encryption Status**: Clear indication of whether tokens are encrypted
- **Validation**: Automatic token validation without exposing the actual token
- **Secure Cleanup**: Safe configuration reset when needed

### Migration and Compatibility

**Seamless Upgrades**
If you're upgrading from an older version of Hyouji:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Hyouji detects plain text configurations
2. **Secure Migration**: Automatically encrypts existing tokens
3. **Backup Safety**: Original configuration is safely migrated
4. **Zero Downtime**: No interruption to your workflow

**Trust Indicators**
Hyouji provides clear feedback about your security status:

- ✅ **Encrypted**: Your token is fully protected
- ⚠️ **Plain Text**: Token needs encryption (auto-migrated on next run)
- ❌ **Missing**: No token saved (will prompt for new one)

This security-first approach means you can use Hyouji with confidence, knowing your GitHub credentials are protected by industry-standard encryption practices.

## Advanced Features

Beyond basic label management, Hyouji includes several advanced features that streamline your workflow and enhance productivity.

### Repository Auto-Detection

**Smart Context Awareness**

```bash
cd my-awesome-project
hyouji
```

```text
# Hyouji automatically detects:
✓ Repository auto-detected: username/my-awesome-project
  Detection method: origin remote
```

**Detection Methods:**

- **Origin Remote**: Uses the `origin` remote URL (most common)
- **First Available Remote**: Falls back to the first remote if no origin exists
- **Manual Input**: Prompts for manual entry if no remotes are found

This feature is particularly useful when working across multiple repositories, as it eliminates the need to manually specify repository details each time.

### Sample File Generation

**Quick Start Templates**
Generate comprehensive label templates instantly:

```bash
hyouji
```

```text
