# CD Workflow Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the CD (Continuous Deployment) workflow that publishes packages to npm when releases are created.

## Test Scenarios Completed

### 1. Workflow File Validation

- ✅ Verified `.github/workflows/publish.yml` exists and is properly configured
- ✅ Confirmed workflow triggers on `release.published` events
- ✅ Validated workflow includes all required steps:
  - Pre-publish validation (CI steps)
  - npm authentication setup
  - Package building
  - npm publishing
  - Post-publish verification

### 2. Pre-publish Validation Steps

- ✅ Confirmed workflow runs all CI validation steps before publishing:
  - ESLint code quality checks
  - Prettier formatting validation
  - TypeScript compilation verification
  - Unit test execution
  - Test coverage validation
  - Package build verification
  - CLI binary testing

### 3. Version Consistency Checks

- ✅ Verified workflow validates version consistency between:
  - `package.json` version field
  - GitHub release tag
  - Handles both `v1.0.0` and `1.0.0` tag formats

### 4. Security Configuration

- ✅ Confirmed secure npm authentication setup:
  - Uses `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret
  - Token is not exposed in logs
  - Proper npm registry configuration
  - Authentication verification before publishing

### 5. Error Handling

- ✅ Verified comprehensive error handling for:
  - Authentication failures
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Version conflicts (duplicate versions)
  - Build failures
  - Publishing failures with retry logic

## Test Scenarios Requiring Live Testing

### 1. Release Creation Test

**Status**: Ready for testing
**Requirements**:

- NPM_TOKEN secret must be configured in repository
- Test should use a patch version increment (e.g., 0.0.3)

**Test Steps**:

1. Update version in `package.json` to `0.0.3`
2. Commit and push changes
3. Create GitHub release with tag `v0.0.3`
4. Monitor workflow execution
5. Verify package is published to npm
6. Test package installation: `npm install github-label-manager@0.0.3`

### 2. Authentication Testing

**Status**: Requires NPM_TOKEN setup
**Test Steps**:

1. Verify NPM_TOKEN is configured as repository secret
2. Test token has publishing permissions for `github-label-manager` package
3. Verify workflow can authenticate with npm registry

### 3. Publishing Verification

**Status**: Dependent on release test
**Test Steps**:

1. Verify package appears on npm registry
2. Test package installation from npm
3. Verify CLI functionality after npm installation
4. Check package metadata and files

## Current Package Status

- **Current Version**: 0.0.2
- **Package Name**: github-label-manager
- **Registry**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-label-manager
- **Repository**: https://github.com/koji/github-label-manager

## Test Results Summary

### CI Integration Tests ✅

- All CI validation steps are properly integrated into CD workflow
- Error handling prevents publishing when validation fails
- Build verification ensures package integrity

### Workflow Configuration ✅

- Proper triggers and job dependencies
- Secure secret management
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- Performance optimizations with caching

### Ready for Live Testing ⏳

The CD workflow is properly configured and ready for live testing with a real release. The workflow includes:

1. **Validation Phase**: Runs all CI checks
2. **Authentication Phase**: Securely authenticates with npm
3. **Publishing Phase**: Builds and publishes package
4. **Verification Phase**: Confirms successful publication

## Recommendations

1. **NPM_TOKEN Setup**: Ensure repository secret is configured with valid npm token
2. **Test Release**: Create a test release (v0.0.3) to validate end-to-end workflow
3. **Monitor First Run**: Closely monitor the first live run for any issues
4. **Rollback Plan**: Keep CircleCI as backup until GitHub Actions is fully validated

## Next Steps

1. Configure NPM_TOKEN repository secret
2. Create test release v0.0.3
3. Monitor workflow execution
4. Validate package publication
5. Test package installation and functionality
